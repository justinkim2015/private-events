# README

This project is called Private Events, done via TheOdinProject(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events).

Overview:
This project was made using ruby on rails and the styling was done via bulma.  

From start to finish this project took me 32.41 hours over 14 days to finish.  The bulk of this time was spent on figure out how to do a many-to-many association with custom names(roughly 10 hours) and learning and implementing my first CSS framework, bulma.  

What I learned:
This project was probably the most difficult project in the rails section up until now due to the unintuitive nature of associations to me.  However, due to the difficulty I encountered with this project, it lead me to review all the individual parts of MVC and rails.  Now, I understand how the parts of rails are linked together and how to create and manage my routes so that everything works as intended.  

Most difficult part:
The most difficult part was the many-to-many association via a through table however, I believe that this was mostly because I didn't have a good grasp of how rails send information to itself internally.  After realizing how names were set and the standards that rails uses, it was a lot easier to make my second many-to-many association for my invites table.  

Most fun part:
The most fun part of this project for me was either using bulma or writing the logic for the UI in the views.  I really enjoyed learning a new framework and it cut down on the design part of the project considerably.  Additionally, I'd been waiting for a time when I'd have to solve some logic puzzles like in the Ruby section of TOP.  Until now, most of the difficulty in the rails section came from understanding what rails wanted from me and typing it exactly.

Things to continue working on:
I think that my views have gotten very bloated and hard to read.  I should move some of the logic I wrote in there to scopes and class methods in the controller.  When refactoring that will be my first thing to do.
